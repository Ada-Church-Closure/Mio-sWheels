## ✨ Motivation

Why did I build this?
- To deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts by implementing them myself.
- To prepare for technical interviews where a solid grasp of fundamentals is key.
- To have fun with "reinventing the wheel" and exploring the internals of common utilities.
- This project serves as a personal coding laboratory and a showcase of my problem-solving skills.

## 🚀 Features / What's Inside

This repository contains my hand-crafted implementations of various data structures and algorithms, **with no external dependencies**. Each implementation includes basic tests and aims for clarity and educational value over raw performance.

- ### **AQS/CLH Queue**

- ### **Simple ThreadPool**
